I began by emailing St. Mary the Virgin Navan Road church to seek permission to record some gravestones. This proved more challenging than I thought. First, the email "hello@bnbvanglican.ca" did not work, apparently no domain was found to have that name. I figured the second b was a typo (since I think that bnv stands for Blackburn Navan Virgin), so I tried "hello@bnvanglican.ca". The domain still apparently did not exist. Then I found the email to another Anglican church in Ottawa which wrote a blog post on their website about this church. I emailed them, and am currently waiting to hear back.

After hearing back from Rev. Rhonda Waters from the church of St. Helen, who gave me premission to take measurements and data from the cemetery of SMV, I went to the cemetery. It was nice to finally see the cemetery after 20 years of driving past it. I started by looking at every gravestone, a majority of which were modern. But most of these modern gravestones had inscribed the date of death in the 19th-early 20th centuries. I think this means that most of the original gravestones were replaced by modern ones. Where did the originals go? it would be a shame if they were thrown out. I found a total of 5 "original" gravestones, that is, gravestones dating to the late 1800's. Two of them were right next to each other, in a prominent location in the cemetery (right infront of the church), which probably suggests they were not moved since they were put there. They are from the Grough family, one is one child who died at the age of four, the other of another child who died aged six. Both were born in 1900, so perhaps they were twins. It is a sad thought. In fact most of these people died before their 60's; the past was a terrible time to be alive.

I had a bit of trouble reading the third gravestone. It was either set up for Maria Rathwell, or William Rathwell; basically the other inscriptions are too weathered away to tell. I did find a useful pdf, https://cths.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Caboose-summer-2021-final.pdf, which talks about the Rathwell family. Relevant to this is the mention of Maria and William Rathwell, the latter died in 1902. So perhaps this grave was dedicated to him and erected shortly after his death. The two clasping hands is an interesting motif and in fact the only motif of these 5 original gravestones.

The last two gravestones tell a very interesting story. As I was making my way back up to the church after walking to the back of the cemetery, I came across there small gravestones which were lying at an almost 90 degree angle against a modern gravestone. One gravestone read "FATHER", the other "MOTHER", and another an illegible word. Yesterday, I was helping Bob and Monica (two NCC archaeologists with whom I worked in the past winter at the NCC looking at lithics and Indigenous pottery) excavate a site at Lac Leamy Park. Unfortunately I did not find anything in my trench, but Bob did show me a picture of something that was excavated in (or around) Ottawa this past summer, three stones which were inscribed with "Father", "Mother", and "Mother" respectively. This was a eureka moment for me. I quickly sent a picture of what I found to Bob, who said that "they look a little older than the ones we found: but same idea for sure". If I remember correctly, Bob had told me those stones he found dated to the early 20th century, so this stones were likely made in the late 1800's. 

To corroborate this, the large granite modern gravestone on which all three were leaning had three names of a family. The first, "John Hudson" died in 1901, the second "Rebecca Purdy" died in 1893, the third, "George Hudson" died in 1907. I think that this proves that in the 3 old gravestones the "FATHER" is John Hudson, "MOTHER" is Rebecca Purdy (Purdy is apparently an extremely common last name for gravestones here), and the third stone is George Hudson.
