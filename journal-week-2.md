I began by emailing St. Mary the Virgin Navan Road church to seek permission to record some gravestones. This proved more challenging than I thought. First, the email "hello@bnbvanglican.ca" did not work, apparently no domain was found to have that name. I figured the second b was a typo (since I think that bnv stands for Blackburn Navan Virgin), so I tried "hello@bnvanglican.ca". The domain still apparently did not exist. Then I found the email to another Anglican church in Ottawa which wrote a blog post on their website about this church. I emailed them, and am currently waiting to hear back.
