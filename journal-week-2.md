I began by emailing St. Mary the Virgin Navan Road church to seek permission to record some gravestones. This proved more challenging than I thought. First, the email "hello@bnbvanglican.ca" did not work, apparently no domain was found to have that name. I figured the second b was a typo (since I think that bnv stands for Blackburn Navan Virgin), so I tried "hello@bnvanglican.ca". The domain still apparently did not exist. Then I found the email to another Anglican church in Ottawa which wrote a blog post on their website about this church. I emailed them, and am currently waiting to hear back.

After hearing back from Rev. Rhonda Waters from the church of St. Helen, who gave me premission to take measurements and data from the cemetery of SMV, I went to the cemetery. It was nice to finally see the cemetery after 20 years of driving past it. I started by looking at every gravestone, a majority of which were modern. But most of these modern gravestones had inscribed the date of death in the 19th-early 20th centuries. I think this means that most of the original gravestones were replaced by modern ones. Where did the originals go? it would be a shame if they were thrown out. I found a total of 5 "original" gravestones, that is, gravestones dating to the late 1800's. Two of them were right next to each other, in a prominent location in the cemetery (right infront of the church), which probably suggests they were not moved since they were put there. They are from the Grough family, one is one child who died at the age of four, the other of another child who died aged six. Both were born in 1900, so perhaps they were twins. It is a sad thought. In fact most of these people died before their 60's; the past was a terrible time to be alive.

I had a bit of trouble reading the third gravestone. It was either set up for Maria Rathwell, or William Rathwell; basically the other inscriptions are too weathered away to tell. I did find a useful pdf, https://cths.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Caboose-summer-2021-final.pdf, which talks about the Rathwell family. Relevant to this is the mention of Maria and William Rathwell, the latter died in 1902. So perhaps this grave was dedicated to him and erected shortly after his death. The two clasping hands is an interesting motif and in fact the only motif of these 5 original gravestones.

The last two gravestones tell a very interesting story. As I was making my way back up to the church after walking to the back of the cemetery, I came across there small gravestones which were lying at an almost 90 degree angle against a modern gravestone. One gravestone read "FATHER", the other "MOTHER", and another an illegible word. Yesterday, I was helping Bob and Monica (two NCC archaeologists with whom I worked in the past winter at the NCC looking at lithics and Indigenous pottery) excavate a site at Lac Leamy Park. Unfortunately I did not find anything in my trench, but Bob did show me a picture of something that was excavated in (or around) Ottawa this past summer, three stones which were inscribed with "Father", "Mother", and "Mother" respectively. This was a eureka moment for me. I quickly sent a picture of what I found to Bob, who said that "they look a little older than the ones we found: but same idea for sure". If I remember correctly, Bob had told me those stones he found dated to the early 20th century, so this stones were likely made in the late 1800's. 

To corroborate this, the large granite modern gravestone on which all three were leaning had three names of a family. The first, "John Hudson" died in 1901, the second "Rebecca Purdy" died in 1893, the third, "George Hudson" died in 1907. I think that this proves that in the 3 old gravestones the "FATHER" is John Hudson (husband), "MOTHER" is Rebecca Purdy (wife) (Purdy is apparently an extremely common last name for gravestones here), and the third stone is George Hudson (son). 

I could not find much about any Hudson family in Navan. There is one prominent Hudson around Ottawa, however, Joe Hudson. In the 1940's, he started Burnbrae farms, which sells eggs across Ottawa (and I think Ontario for that matter). You know that smiling egg with the hat? He was born in Brockville, and Hudson is a popular English last name, so I doubt there is any real connection here between this modern gravestone and an egg empire. But some family with the last name Hudson must have rebuilt this gravestone, and had the money to do so (and who would bother to shell out thousands to rebuild a gravestone of family members you never met other than some family with money). If I asked the church, they would probably give me a much more sensible answer.

The third grave did not conform specifically to any gravestone typology which we were provided with, but did match close enough to one that I'd consider it a minor stylistic difference and close enough to just enter the provided typology. It also included two different fonts, so I just but in sans serif (which was used to inscribe the names of the deceased.


"As archaeologists, we operate from an inherent place of privilege regarding ouraccess to direct evidence of the past." Dennis, L. 2021. Getting It Right and Getting It Wrong in Digital Archaeological Ethics. In: Champion, E (ed.), Virtual Heritage. London: Ubiquity Press. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/bck.j 106. 

There is also privilege when considering socioeconomics; that we are lucky to be able to do archaeology because our financial position allows for it.

"For every tool under consideration, we should ask, ‘Is the use of this tool ina digital form adding value to the project that is balanced by the ethics of itsuse?’ For every methodological consideration, we should ask, ‘Is this approach,mediated digitally, fulfilling all of our needs for it, without adding undue ethi-cal burden or breach?’ If the answer to either of those questions is no, the use ofthe digital form should be weighed against the analog form." Dennis, L. 2021. Getting It Right and Getting It Wrong in Digital Archaeological Ethics. In: Champion, E (ed.), Virtual Heritage. London: Ubiquity Press. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/bck.j 109.

Also the public is less likely to understand advanced digital methods being applied in archaeology, like certain ArcGIS feautres. So maybe we also owe it to the public to explain what is actually being done.

I hadn't at all considered ethics in digital archaeology, probably because, like everything digital, its not as intuitive as the physical world and physical archaeology (which I wouldn't consider "real" archaeology anymore, both digital and physical archaeology are real). Archaeological databases online do pose an inherent risk of being comprised through hacking, which could become an issue in the future, although I don't think many hackers would have a clear rationale for hacking archaeological databases. But if these databases are being used to store sensitive information, like human remains, and they do get compromised, this would definitely pose an ethical concern.


"Cemeteries are a delicate balance between public and private;
funerary monuments in particular are at once motivated by public
retrospection and private grief and emotion" Cook, Katherine. 2018 Open Data as Public Archaeology: The Monumental Archive Project. AP: Online Journal of Public Archaeology 3: 177-194. 178.

Although modern grave sties do draw stronger emotions out of people, especially those who have relatives buried there. The ethics of conducting work at grave sites becomes more challenging the more modern said site is. The Keramicus in Athens is well over 2500 years old, and the remains there are treated much more archaeologically and historically and less emphathetically.

"To do so, the project set out to develop a web-based interface
(Figure 2) structured around an open database of curated3
collections" Cook, Katherine. 2018 Open Data as Public Archaeology: The Monumental Archive Project. AP: Online Journal of Public Archaeology 3: 177-194. 181.

I wish this could be done for all cemeteries, but that would be a near impossible task unless many dollars and people were allocated to it.

I have seen the growth in popularity of the public cleaning old gravestones, and while I'm sure most of the time they do get permission to do so, it does worry me. I feel that it is more for content and money than it is for actually doing a good deed. Cemeteries have also become more popular places in recent years, with aesthetics like cemeterycore attracting people. This isn't necessarily wrong, but I think it in many ways disrespects the dead buried there, especially the less someone knows about a certain cemetery.
